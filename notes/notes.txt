- TODO:
	- Check theres no way to hide the loco health bars when damaged. Maybe keep them as full health and just trasnfer the damage to the center.
	- Look at Factorio Extended integration. Probbaly just add my own varieties when Factorio Extended is present or maybe a config option.
    - When you hover over the loco you see just the wheel graphics, can I set or hide this entirely.
    - When you hover ove the cargo wagon part it shows the cargo wagon zoomed in really far.
    - Check mining a damaged train and placing it back down.
    - Try to support blueprinting a train with fuel and converting the fule request between the entity swap so you end up with fuel requests on the bog built train.
    - Support modified versions of my placement and part entities. They often seem to add a suffix to my entity names for eletric trains, other mods and this one specificly https://mods.factorio.com/mod/single_train_unit/discussion/5f576f615f5888c2fb8a5b1b
    - Review compatibility with Train Construction Site mod and deal with anything.

- Graphics:
    - Make graphics for new vehicle (cargo wagon entity).
    - Make graphics for wheels both ends (wheels on locos) - Use half the wheel graphics with connctors facing outwards as will be 2 copies on each loco entity. Needs white space adding to the end of each sprite sheets when remade to space them. Can't be the loco entity picture as this can't have its render layer set and so wheels will overlap wagon in some orientations.
    - Allow color to be pasted on the cargo wagon as it has the graphics. Copy from WagonColors mod.
    - Vertical cargo and fluid unit's graphics aren't aligned correctly. Most noticable that the pump doesn't align correctly on graphics.
	- Add a second graphic option to use a tram render suggested by Klonan: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/tatra-t3-76aa08d7c06340fc89229551c45e3c3a

- Deferred:
    - Handle mod entity placement.

- Not Possible (presently):
    - Share color settings on the 2 locos and apply to the single combined graphic. No simple event to flag when color is changed so not sure how to detect this. Maybe train the train GUI being opened/closed and apply colors then ?
    - Be able to detach single unit trains from other rolling stock. Not possible as the event is identical for when each part of a single unit train is being attached as to when a user tries to detach it.
    - Prevent the player from walking through a unit. As there needs to be gaps in the parts collision boes so it can turn corners.
    - An event that damages multiple parts of a unit will accumilate damage too fast. i.e. a grenade hitting all 3 parts will do triple damage to the unit parts due to damage sharing vs a normal train being hit by a grenade.
