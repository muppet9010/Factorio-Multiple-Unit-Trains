- TODO:
    - Support modified versions of my placement and part entities. They often seem to add a suffix to my entity names for eletric trains, other mods and this one specificly https://mods.factorio.com/mod/single_train_unit/discussion/5f576f615f5888c2fb8a5b1b
    - Review compatibility with Train Construction Site mod and deal with anything. Think this needs to add reacting to mod placement ???
	- Look at Factorio Extended mods integration
        - Probably just add my own varieties when either FactorioExtended and FactorioExtended Plus (2 seperate mods) is present.
        - Have different recipes based on the mods increase ratios.
        - Have different train values based on the mods increase ratios.
        - Have different cargo values based on the mods increase ratios.
        - Just tint the icons and whole spritesheets for now as a simple fix.
    - Be able to detach single unit trains from other rolling stock. Not possible as the event is identical for when each part of a single unit train is being attached as to when a user tries to detach it. Maybe I check what wagon you are in and if there is an adjacant non single train unit wagon I detach that?

- Graphics:
    - Make graphics for new vehicle (cargo wagon entity).
    - Make graphics for wheels both ends (wheels on locos) - Use half the wheel graphics with connctors facing outwards as will be 2 copies on each loco entity. Needs white space adding to the end of each sprite sheets when remade to space them. Can't be the loco entity picture as this can't have its render layer set and so wheels will overlap wagon in some orientations.
    - Allow color to be pasted on the cargo wagon as it has the graphics. Copy from WagonColors mod.
    - Vertical cargo and fluid unit's graphics aren't aligned correctly. Most noticable that the pump doesn't align correctly on graphics.
	- Add a second graphic option to use a tram render suggested by Klonan: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/tatra-t3-76aa08d7c06340fc89229551c45e3c3a

- Deferred:
    - Handle mod entity placement.
    - Try to support blueprinting a train with fuel and converting the fule request between the entity swap so you end up with fuel requests on the bog built train. Needs to replace the locos with fuel request hidden entities. But keep track of these to the wargo part ghost so if the cargo is removed the requests go also. When the cargo is built the hidden entities are "triggered" and make the real fuel requests to the loco parts. Also have to make the loco blueprintable. Sample code for reacting to BP being made:
                    Events.RegisterHandler(
                        defines.events.on_player_setup_blueprint,
                        "test1",
                        function(event)
                            local player = game.get_player(event.player_index)
                            local blueprint = player.blueprint_to_setup
                            local entities = blueprint.get_blueprint_entities()
                            blueprint.set_blueprint_entities(entities)
                        end
                    )

- Not Possible (presently):
    - Share color settings on the 2 locos and apply to the single combined graphic. No simple event to flag when color is changed so not sure how to detect this. Maybe train the train GUI being opened/closed and apply colors then ?
    - Prevent the player from walking through a unit. As there needs to be gaps in the parts collision boes so it can turn corners.
