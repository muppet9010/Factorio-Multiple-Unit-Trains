# Single Train Unit

A single unit comprising of a small cargo wagon and locomotives at both ends. Total size is of a standard locomotive or cargo wagon.

Overview
============

- Place the dual headed cargo wagon in the usual manner and it will be replaced out for the 2 mini locos and cargo wagon. Can only be placed by the player. Intended for use as single unit trains, but can be joined togeather.
- The unit can be mined by the player as a whole and will be damaged/destroyed as a whole.
- The unit's first and last 2 tiles are for feeding fuel to the locos. The middle 3 tiles are for accessing the small cargo wagon.
- The unit runs at a similar speed to a single loco and wagon, but using much less space. It consumes fuel at twice the usual loco rate to account for its compact dual direction nature.

Not Implimented Yet
================

- Ability to blueprint and deconstruct the train via robot. At present the units aren't selectable for either.
- Proper modified graphics.
- A fluid tanker version.
- Coloring of the unit.
- If players inventory is full when the unit is mined.

Limitations
================

- Don't build a train with multiple single train units in it out of order. Start at one end and place each one sequentially. As placing a middle single train unit between 2 other rail wagons may not place correctly.
- There is no way to detach a single train unit from a larger train, it must be deconstructed. The disconnect wagon command will be effectively undone.
