A single train unit comprising of a small cargo wagon and a locomotives at both ends. Total size is of a standard locomotive or cargo wagon.

Demo Mod - Don't play any long term games with it.
============

This is a concept demo mod and you shouldn't play any long term games with it. It may not be updated or supported in the future. However, by all means have an experiment with it and see if its a good idea or not. See the known limitations and not implimented yet items below.

Overview
============

- Place the dual headed cargo wagon in the usual manner and it will be replaced out for the 2 mini locos and mini cargo wagon. - It can only be placed and picked up by the player, not bots.
- Intended for use as single unit trains, but they be joined togeather or joined with other locomotives or wagons (see Limitations).
- The unit will be mined by the player as a whole and will be damaged/destroyed as a whole, with damage shared across all parts.
- The unit's first and last 2 tiles are for feeding fuel to the locos. The middle 3 tiles are for accessing the small cargo wagon. So all 7 tiles of the units length are usable by inserters.
- The unit runs between the performance of a single loco & wagon and a dual headed train with a wagon. It consumes fuel at twice the usual loco rate to account for its compact dual direction nature.
- The cargo wagon space is 1/2 of a standard cargo wagon.
- The unit is unlocked with the standard Railway research.

Not Implimented Yet
================

- Ability to blueprint and deconstruct the train via robot. At present the units aren't selectable for either action.
- Proper modified graphics to account for the changes.
- A fluid tanker version.
- Coloring of the unit.

Limitations
================

- Don't build a train with multiple single train units in it out of order. Start at one end and place each one sequentially. As placing a middle single train unit between 2 other rail wagons may not place correctly.
- There is no way to detach a single train unit from a larger train, it must be deconstructed. The disconnect wagon command will be effectively undone.
