# Single Train Unit





Limitations
================

- Don't build a train with multiple single train units in it out of order. Start at one end and place each one sequentially. As placing a middle single train unit between 2 other rail wagons may not place correctly.
- There is no way to detach a single train unit from a larger train, it must be deconstructed. The disconnect wagon command will be effectively undone.
