+ Make a placement vehicle that when placed becomes the 3 sub parts:
    + Handle player placement.
    + Handle player mining.
+ Merged entities behavour:
    + If one part is deconstructed the whole single train unit should be picked up.
    + Link damage between the 3 parts.
    + Avoid the uncoupling of the inner cargo wagon from the locos.
- Balance:
    - Apply approperiate cargo size, train fuel inventory, speed and weight to the sub parts so that they are equal to half a regular loco pulling a single wagon.
    - Crafting cost equal to 2 locos and a wagon.
- Blueprint support:
    - If placed train is blueprinted convert BP item to the placable one or handle this scenario some other way.
- Bot support:
    - Handle bot placement.
    - Handle bot mining.
    - Handle mod entity placement?
- Graphics:
    - Make rough graphics for new vehicle.
    - Make rough single train wheel graphics to avoid the weirdness - make them stick out less from the centre so they fit under the MU body better and don't overlap so bad when joined up.
    - Make a unique minimap image.

- Future ideas:
    - Fluid train version.

- Not Possible:
    - Share color settings on the 2 locos and apply to combined graphics. No simple event to flag when color is changed so not sure how to detect this.
    - Be able to detach single unit trains from other rolling stock. Not possible as the event is identical for when each part of a single unit train is being attached as to when a user tries to detach it.
