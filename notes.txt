make a placement vehicle that when placed becomes the 3 sub parts
if placed train is blueprinted convert BP item to the placable one or handle this scenario some other way
make rough graphics for new vehicle
make rough single train wheel graphics to avoid the weirdness - make them stick out less from the centre so they fit under the MU body better and don't overlap so bad when joined up
link damage between the 3 parts, should ahve health equal to 1 loco
share color setting on the 2 locos and apply to combined graphics
avoid the uncoupling of the inner cargo wagon from the locos. ideally the locos can detach from the loco of another connected combined unit
apply approperiate cargo size, train fuel inventory, speed and weight to the sub parts so that they are equal to a regular loco pulling 1 wagon.
apply impact damage equal to 1 loco and 1 wagon as it is heavy.
