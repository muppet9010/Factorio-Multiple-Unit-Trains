single_train_unit-use_wip_graphics=If to use the Work In Progress graphics or not. The WIP graphics will jump between different graphics on rotation, as many haven't been made yet. Otherwise the vanilla game wagon graphics will be used in all rotations.
single_train_unit-wagon_capacity_percentage=How large the cargo and fluid wagons versions are of their full size types. Mod default is 50 percent.
single_train_unit-weight_percentage=How heavy the parts of the train are to their full size types. Lower weight means greater acceleration. Mod default is 70 percent.
single_train_unit-burner_effectivity_percentage=How effectivily the fuel is burnt. Lower means more fuel used per movement. Mod default is 50 percent.
single_train_unit-burner_inventory_size=How big the fuel inventories of the locomotive ends are. Lower value makes refrueling more of a logisitical challange. Mod default is 1.
